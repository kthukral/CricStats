In Dev currently 
- Attempting to impliment Swipe Gesture Recognizers on Table View Cells to display quick stats behind the cells

This is a shell for an iPhone stats application. Currently the application is made using sample stats from cricket. The application consists of 3 main views, the team table view, the player table view and a tab view controller for the stats (batting and bowling). Selecting a team leads you to the player table view and selecting a player will lead you to the Batting stats and you can switch to Bowling stats using a tab bar at the bottom of the view. Currently plist files are used to populate the team table view and the player table view. Only Team India contains players at this momment.

The application is designed so that anyone looking to develop a stats application can use an API to obtain the stats and connect it to this shell and hopefully, only basic changes are required to get the application is a working condition.
